### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

- I studied the figma file to work out how to lay out the pages, which sections should be laid out in Flexbox or CSS Grid.
- From the Figma file I also figured out the CSS variables to use and set up utility classes for the site. 
- I did it in mobile first approach, but the HTML was coded from the desktop layout whilst the CSS was done from mobile up!
- I set up the layout for each page and then did each section separately in mobile, tablet and then desktop.
- I decided to leave all hover states for the navigation section and the footer on all pages. I also changed the navigation headings on the extra pages to reflect how  it would work if it was a 'real' website. The figma file provided only used the homepage navigation template for all the pages which wouldn't work so I customised each navigation for every page so that if you clicked on a link it would take you to the correct pages.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript 

### What I learned

This challenge was a test of my CSS Grid and Flexbox skills. After completing it I feel a lot more comfortable with CSS Grid and Flexbox for laying out the pages and the individual sections. My css is flowing more naturrally and I understand better what I have to do when I encounter any issues I can't fix at first try. A good tip is to move on to something else while your mind is solving the issue in the background! It really works even though it may take a day or two to crystalise!

Svgs were used a lot throughout the site, in the social links on hover, and when moving svgs around in the grid container. I was experiencing some issues here and after spending a lot of time researching how to solve them I had to settle for some self made hacks that aren't completely like the figma design file but still works well! The one take from this project is that I will have to study more on how to work with SVGs.

### Continued development

I am eager to do more similar projects and improve more. Still need to work on my Javascript as sometimes I overcomplicate things!

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flex & Grid, Complete Guide with Real World Examples and Code Snippets. An e-book by Shruti Balasa](https://www..shrutibalasa.com) - This helped me with the header and footer navs and understanding how to align the flex or grid items correctly. Highly recommended!
